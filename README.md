# KUSP-spin-tracking

Background

This project was done in the scope of KUSP 2016 (http://kusp.ibs.re.kr/). Its aim is to compare the computational efficiency and accuracy of a Geometric Algebra (GA) approach - in simulating the evolution of a particle's spin - with those of the conventional cross product (CP) approach. For more info, take a look at: http://tinyurl.com/j4wzwq8.

1. multivector.py

  Contains the "multivector" class to represent linear combinations of geometric objects.

2. testSuite

  Contains the "varyingBFieldTestSession" class to test the GA and CP approaches, and plot graphs of the results.
