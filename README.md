# Geometric Algebra library and spin simluations

Background

This project was done in the scope of KUSP 2016 (http://kusp.ibs.re.kr/). Its aim is to compare the computational efficiency and accuracy of a Geometric Algebra (GA) approach - in simulating the evolution of a particle's spin - with those of the conventional cross product (CP) approach. For more info on the project, take a look at: http://tinyurl.com/j4wzwq8. For more on GA: http://tinyurl.com/h7ogoe5.

1. multivector.py: Contains the "multivector" class to represent linear combinations of geometric objects.

2. testSuite: Contains the "varyingBFieldTestSession" class to test the GA and CP approaches, and plot graphs of the results.
